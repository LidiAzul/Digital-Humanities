# Lidia Ponce de la Vega's Digital Humanities Repository

## Short biography

My name is Lidia Ponce de la Vega. I am a grad student from Mexico City and I just started my PhD in Hispanic Studies. I did my MA in Hispanic Studies at McGill University and my BA in Hispanic Language and Literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. My main research interests include animal studies and border studies, as well as translation studies. 

# My Research Project

For my dissertation, I would like to contrast the representation and the relation between animals –human and nonhuman— in two moments in the tradition of bestiaries in America: the *Sumario de la Historia Natural de las Indias* (1522) by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, and three Mexican bestiaries from the 20th and 21st centuries: *Bestiario* (1938) by Juan José Arreola, “Especies en peligro (y otras víctimas)” in *Islas a la deriva* (1975) by José Emilio Pacheco, and *El bosque de los prodigios* (2007) by René Avilés Fabila. 

# My Objectives for the course

* to learn more about the wide scope of disciplines comprehended under the term "Digital Humanities"
* to learn digital tools that could help me enhance my own research
* to open up to knew forms of studying the humanities and let go of the *fear* of programming and digital languages or tools
* to incorporate digital tools to my previous (and mostly traditional/analogue) methods of research
