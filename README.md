# Lidia Ponce de la Vega's Digital Humanities Repository

## Short biography

My name is Lidia Ponce de la Vega. I am a grad student from Mexico and I just started my PhD in Hispanic Studies at McGill University. I did my MA in Hispanic Studies at McGill University as well, and my BA in Hispanic Language and Literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City. My main research interests include animal studies and border studies, as well as translation studies. I have worked with the representation of the Mexico-US border in both cinema and videogames. 

# My Research Project

For my dissertation, I would like to contrast the representation of and the relation between animals –human and nonhuman— in two moments in the tradition of bestiaries in America: the *Sumario de la Historia Natural de las Indias* (1522) by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, and three Mexican bestiaries from the 20th and 21st centuries: *Bestiario* (1938) by Juan José Arreola, “Especies en peligro (y otras víctimas)” in *Islas a la deriva* (1975) by José Emilio Pacheco, and *El bosque de los prodigios* (2007) by René Avilés Fabila. 

# My Objectives for the Course

* to learn more about the wide scope of disciplines comprised under the term "Digital Humanities"
* to learn digital tools that could (and hopefully will) help me improve my own research
* to open up to knew forms of studying the humanities, and let go of the *fear* of programming and digital languages/tools
* to incorporate digital tools to my previous (and mostly traditional/analogue) methods of research
