William Wordsworth, in *Guide to the Lakes*, seeks to employ travel guides as an educational tool to raise awareness for the conservation of nature, and to stand against travel as a form of colonization. In turn, Margaret Linley compares Wordsworth’s work to the environmental and human costs of digital humanities through the analysis of the *Lake District Online* project, a digital archive of historical documents from the Lake District in the UK, dated between 1709 and 2000. The author explores Wordsworth’s concepts of access and openness of space, as well as of colonial violence, and relates them to the “emerging digital environments” in terms of “politics and ethics of place making.” Linley’s objective of reflecting on the “colonial legacies” that determine the production, access, and organization of nature in digital humanities is achieved by analysing the historical evolution of the space, and the relation between humans and land/earth.

By developing on a previous article and by analysing the digital data compiled in the *Hansard Corpus* and the *Historical Thesaurus of English* (HT), Marc Alexander and Andrew Struan explore the lexicalization process of the semantic categories *uncivilized* and *civilization/lack of civilization* in British Parliament speeches between 1803 and 2005. Terms pertaining to these categories, mostly used in the context of colonization and imperialism, were classified into “five families of meaning:” animality, illness, otherness, savagery, and innocence. Said terms were also further analysed in their relation to the foreign and the domestic, and in their use to classify peoples, things, actions/practices, and spaces, across time. The authors conclude by signaling a shift in the concept of the *uncivil* that goes from foreign subjects/spaces to domestic practices, probably due to “increased oppositionality” in the digital record of the Parliament.

*Textometrica* is a free online tool for text analysis. In the first stage of analysis, *Textometrica* allows users to set parameters for word selection in a text, such as length of words, stop words, and exclusion of terms containing a certain combination of characters. After this first selection, it is possible to establish minimum and maximum frequencies to select words for further analysis, and later classify them by creating semantic categories (concepts). Later on, *Textometrica* provides a list of the selected terms and concepts, as well as their individual and co-occurrence frequencies. The final product of the analysis is a customizable co-occurrences graph that shows the linkages between the selected terms and concepts of the text. Overall, *Textometrica* is a very straightforward, easy-to-use tool that allows for a basic text-mining and visual representation of the semantic relations between terms in a given text.
